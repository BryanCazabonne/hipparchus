              Hipparchus 1.0 RELEASE NOTES

The Hipparchus team is pleased to announce the release of hipparchus 1.0.

The Hipparchus library is a self-contained library of mathematical components. It started as a
fork of Apache Commons Math.

This is the first release of the library.  Hipparchus is divided into modules.  This release includes all
modules.  Subsequently, modules may be released separately.

Following is a summary of the differences between Hipparchus and Apache Commons Math at the time of the fork
(February, 2016).

o  The library has been modularized into several components
   (hipparchus-core, hipparchus-clustering, hipparchus-fft,
   hipparchus-fitting, hipparchus-genetics, hipparchus-geometry,
   hipparchus-geometry, hipparchus-ode, hipparchus-optim,
   hipparchus-samples, hipparchus-stat).  All other components depend on hipparchus-core,
   and hipparchus-clustering depends on hipparchus-stat. 
o  EmpiricalDistribution and MultivariateNormalExpectationMaximization have been moved from
   the random package into stat.fitting and ValueServer has been dropped. 
o  Sampling (random deviate generation) has been removed from distribution implementations 
   and consolidated into RandomDataGenerator in the random package. 
o  The TestUtils implemendation class in core stat.inference has been renamed to InferenceTestUtils
   and TestUtils in the core unit test package has been renamed to UnitTestUtils. 
o  The descriptive statistics package has been refactored to simplify API and implementations
   and to use more meaningful class names. 
o  The Ordinary Differential Equations API has been revamped to match the new API introduced with
   field-based ODE. 
o  The exceptions hierarchy has been simplified and many exception classes have been eliminated. 
o  Hipparchus includes a migration module and an associated script
   to help switching from Apache Commons Math to Hipparchus.

For complete information on Hipparchus, including instructions on how to submit bug reports,
patches, or suggestions for improvement, see the Hipparchus website:

Each module has its own set of reports on the website, including a more detailed changelog.
