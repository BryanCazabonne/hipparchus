              Hipparchus RELEASE NOTES

The Hipparchus team is pleased to announce the release of hipparchus 1.0

The Hipparchus project is a library of lightweight, self-contained
mathematics and statistics components addressing the most common
problems not available in the Java programming language.

This is the first release of the library.

Changes in this version include:

o Forked from the Apache Commons Math library.
o Modularized the library into several components
  (hipparchus-core, hipparchus-clustering, hipparchus-fft,
   hipparchus-fitting, hipparchus-genetics, hipparchus-geometry,
   hipparchus-geometry, hipparchus-ode, hipparchus-optim,
   hipparchus-perf, hipparchus-samples)
o Creation of a migration module and an associated script
  to help switching from Apache Commons Math to Hipparchus
o Simplified exception hierarchy
o Revamped Ordinary Differential Equations API to match
  the new API introduced with field-based ODE
