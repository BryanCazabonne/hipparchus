              Hipparchus 1.1 RELEASE NOTES

The Hipparchus team is pleased to announce the release of hipparchus-1.1

The Hipparchus library is a library of mathematical components. It started as a fork of Apache Commons Math.

This is a maintenance release.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o issues/19:  Core: Added support for sampling from enumerated distributions in RandomDataGenerator.
              Fixes Github issue #19. 
o issues/18:  Core: Added support for exact integration in PolynomialFunction.
              Fixes Github issue #18. 
o           Core: Added proper implementations of equals and hashCode to Fields so they
              can be used as keys in maps. 
o           Core: Added a derivatives method in Hermite interpolator, similar to the one
              from FieldHermiteInterpolator. 
o           Core: Added field-based derivative structures. 
o           Stat: Add implementation of RANDOM algorithm for streaming percentile computation. 
o           Stat: Add default "toString()" implementation to "AbstractStorelessUnivariateStatistic". 
o           Stat: "StorelessUnivariateStatistic", "DescriptiveStatistics" and "StreamingStatistics"
              now extend from "DoubleConsumer", allowing to easily use them within streams. 
o           Geometry: Added field based 3D lines. 
o           Geometry: Added utility methods for field-based rotations and 3D vectors. 

Fixed Bugs:
o issues/17:  Core: Added field-based QR decomposition.
              Fixes Github issue #17. Thanks to Andrea Antolino. 
o           Core: Improved parameter validation for probabilities provided to enumerated distribution
              constructors. 
o issues/13:  Stat: Fixed overly-aggressive sufficient data check in OLS/GLS regression classes.
              When there is no intercept in the model, the number of observations can equal
              the number of regressors.  Fixes GitHub #13. 
o           Stat: Fixed bug in 2-sided binomial test leading to inflated p-values in some
              cases.  This was reported against Commons Math as MATH-1381. 
o issues/7:  Ode: Fixed Field ODE integrators handling of secondary equations.
              GitHub: fixes #7. 
o issues/20:  Geometry: Fixed numerical noise issues in Welzl smallest enclosing ball computation.
              Thanks to jerdmanGH for reporting the issue.
              Fixes GitHub #20. 

Changes:
o           Core: Added a factory to simplify building DerivativeStructure instances.
o issues/12:  Core: Performance improvement for Array2DRowRealMatrix.getSubMatrix() (and also
              Array2DRowFieldMatrix.getSubMatrix()).
              Fixes Github issue #12. Thanks to Christoph Dibak. 
o           Core: Added methods to expose the probability mass function to EnumeratedRealDistribution
              and EnumeratedIntegerDistribution.
