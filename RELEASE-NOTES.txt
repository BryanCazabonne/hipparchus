              Hipparchus 1.4 RELEASE NOTES

The Hipparchus team is pleased to announce the release of hipparchus-1.4

The Hipparchus library is a library of mathematical components. It started as a fork of Apache Commons Math.

This is a maintenance release. The main changes since last version are the introduction of bilinear
interpolation for 2D grids, field versions of sinCos and a way to build three-dimensional field arrays,
accessors for state transition matrix, Jacobian matrix H, innovation covariance matrix and Kalman gain
in Kalman filters, support for complex ordinary differential equations (both primary and secondary
equations), and various fixes in partitioning.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o issues/48:  Added bilinear interpolation for 2D grids.
              Github: fixes #48.
o issues/47:  Added field version of sinCos.
              Github: fixes #47.
o issues/39:  Added support for complex ordinary differential equations (both primary and secondary equations).
              Github: fixes #39.
o issues/43:  Added accessors for state transition matrix, Jacobian matrix H, innovation covariance matrix
              and Kalman gain in Kalman filters.
              GitHub: fixes #43.
o             Added a way to build three-dimensional field arrays.

Fixed Bugs:
o issues/45:  Fixed 2D outline extraction from 3D polyhedrons sets with holes.
              GitHub: fixes #45.
o issues/44:  Fixed wrong construction of an Illinois solver that really built a Pegasus solver.
              Github: fixes #44.
o issues/4:   Renamed scale parameter to location parameter in the log-normal distribution,
              to avoid confusion.
              Github: fixes #4.
o issues/42:  Use topological information from BSP tree to connect more reliably edges and
              vertices when building the boundary loops of SphericalPolygonsSet.
              GitHub: fixes #42.
o issues/42:  Forbid use of unrealistic tolerances (below ulp(2Ï€)) in spherical geometry.
              GitHub: fixes #42.
o issues/41:  Fixed a corner case in BSPTree split.
              GitHub: fixes #41.
o issues/40:  Bisection solvers failed to raise an exception when the search
              interval did not bracket a root.
              GitHub: fixes #40.
