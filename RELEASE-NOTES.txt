              Hipparchus 1.3 RELEASE NOTES

The Hipparchus team is pleased to announce the release of hipparchus-1.3

The Hipparchus library is a library of mathematical components. It started as a fork of Apache Commons Math.

This is a maintenance release. The main changes since last version are the introduction of
complex eigen decomposition, introduction of a solver for continuous time algebraic Riccati equation,
a new Kalman module featuring both a filter for linear processes and a filter for non-linear processes,
capability for secondary equations to update the derivatives of the primary equation in ODE, and
introduction of a matrix decomposer to configure decomposition threshold independently of the matrix.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o issues/36:  Added in FastMath the methods Java 9 added in StrictMath.
                This ensures FastMath is always a drop-in replacement for Math/StrictMath.
                Github: fixes #36. 
o             Added new utility methods to create real and field vectors from dimension. 
o             Allow FastMath to operate on RealFieldElements.
                This simplifies a lot "fieldification" of algorithms
                previously implemented with primitive double numbers. 
o             Added a transposeMultiply method to compute A^T.B
                without creating the intermediate transposed matrix. 
o             Added a multiplyTransposed method to compute A.B^T
                without creating the intermediate transposed matrix. 
o issues/32:  Added linear and extended Kalman filters, with support for outliers rejection. 
o             Added MatrixDecomposer interface that encapsulates algorithms tolerances. Thanks to Evan Ward. 
o             Added a way to compute both sin and cos at once faster than performing two calls.
                This also speeds up DerivativeStructure.sin and DerivativeStructure.cos. 
o issues/31:  Allow secondary equations to update derivatives of primary equation in ODE.
                GitHub: fixes #31. 
o issues/29:  Added a solver for Continuous time Algebraic Riccati Equation. Thanks to Alessandro Romero. 
o             Added complex eigen decomposition. Thanks to Alessandro Romero. 

Fixed Bugs:
o issues/35:  Added FieldUnivariateVectorFunction and FieldUnivariateMatrixFunction interfaces,
                as well as RealFieldUnivariateVectorFunction and RealFieldUnivariateMatrixFunction 
                Github: fixes #35. 
o issues/34:  Added FieldUnivariateFunction interface and have polynomials implement it.
                Github: fixes #34. 
o issues/30:  Fixed a problem with eigen decomposition of matrices with large coefficients.
                Github: fixes #30.
