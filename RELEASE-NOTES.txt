              Hipparchus 1.3 RELEASE NOTES

The Hipparchus team is pleased to announce the release of hipparchus-1.3

The Hipparchus library is a library of mathematical components. It started as a fork of Apache Commons Math.

This is a maintenance release. The main changes since last version are the introduction of complex eigen decomposition,
introduction of a solver for continuous time algebraic Riccati equation, a new Kalman module featuring both a filter
for linear processes and a filter for non-linear processes, capability for secondary equations to update the derivatives
of the primary equation in ODE, and introduction of a matrix decomposer to configure decomposition threshold independently
of the matrix.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o issues/36:  Added in FastMath the methods Java 9 added in StrictMath.
              This ensures FastMath is always a drop-in replacement for Math/StrictMath.
              Github: fixes #36. 
o             Added new utility methods to create real and field vectors from dimension. 
o             Allow FastMath to operate on RealFieldElements.
              This simplifies a lot "fieldification" of algorithms
              previously implemented with primitive double numbers. 
o             Added a transposeMultiply method to compute A^T.B
              without creating the intermediate transposed matrix. 
o             Added a multiplyTransposed method to compute A.B^T
              without creating the intermediate transposed matrix. 
o issues/32:  Added linear and extended Kalman filters, with support for outliers rejection. 
o             Added MatrixDecomposer interface that encapsulates algorithms tolerances. Thanks to Evan Ward. 
o             Added a way to compute both sin and cos at once faster than performing two calls.
              This also speeds up DerivativeStructure.sin and DerivativeStructure.cos. 
o issues/31:  Allow secondary equations to update derivatives of primary equation in ODE.
              GitHub: fixes #31. 
o issues/29:  Added a solver for Continuous time Algebraic Riccati Equation. Thanks to Alessandro Romero. 
o             Added complex eigen decomposition. Thanks to Alessandro Romero. 

Fixed Bugs:
o issues/35:  Added FieldUnivariateVectorFunction and FieldUnivariateMatrixFunction interfaces,
              as well as RealFieldUnivariateVectorFunction and RealFieldUnivariateMatrixFunction 
              Github: fixes #35. 
o issues/34:  Added FieldUnivariateFunction interface and have polynomials implement it.
              Github: fixes #34. 
o issues/30:  Fixed a problem with eigen decomposition of matrices with large coefficients.
              Github: fixes #30. 
o issues/38:  Corrected MannWhitneyTest to report the U statistic used in the test and improved
              accuracy of the reported p-values by 1) adding an implementation
              of exact computation for small sample sizes 2) applying continuity correction
              to the normal approximation when this is used 3) adjusting variance for the presence
              of ties in the data. The problem with the U statistic was reported against Apache
              Commons Math as MATH-1453. 
o issues/37:  Corrected WilcoxonSignedRankTest to discard tied pairs and to correctly perform
              continuity correction when estimating p-values using the normal approximation.
              This was reported against Apache Commons Math as MATH-1233.
