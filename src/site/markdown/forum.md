# Hipparchus Forum

Hipparchus has two communication channels, a forum an mailing lists.

The recommended channel is the forum, as the mailing lists have recurring
technical problems. There are three categories
[Hipparchus annoucements](https://forum.orekit.org/c/hipparchus-announcements),
[Hipparchus usage](https://forum.orekit.org/c/hipparchus-usage) and
[Hipparchus development](https://forum.orekit.org/c/hipparchus-development)
in the forum. Regular users should subscribe to the forum and if configure
their preferences to add these categories to the "Watched" list so they are
notified when a new message appears there.

The second channel is the mailing lists. As stated above, they have
recurring technical problems and will therefore be phased out in
the future. Anybody can subscribe to the lists:

  * users@hipparchus.org
  * developers@hipparchus.org
  * announce@hipparchus.org

The archives of the lists are available at [https://lists.hipparchus.org/](https://lists.hipparchus.org/).

Questions related to the usage of Hipparchus should be posted to the
users forum category/mailing list. The developers forum category/mailing list
is for questions and discussion related to the development of Hipparchus.
Please do not cross-post; developers are also subscribed to the users channel.
The announcements forum category/mailing list is read-only
and devoted to announce important news (like new releases).
