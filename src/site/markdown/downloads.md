# Downloads

## Development Library version

The development version of the Hipparchus library is always available to
download from our version control system. We use [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
as our SCM. The anonymous read access to our Git repository  allows users who
need the latest features and the latest bug fixes to get them even before an
official release.

The Git repository can be cloned using the following command, which can
be easily adapted if you are using one of the numerous Git graphical
user interface available or if Git is supported by you integrated
development environment:

    git clone https://github.com/Hipparchus-Math/hipparchus

## Released Library versions

Hipparchus is provided both in several packaging systems. You can pick up
the one that better suits your needs. Source packages are the most complete
ones since the other packages (binary jars, javadoc jars and even the bulk
of this site) are created from these sources.

Hipparchus is also available in maven central repository,
with groupID org.hipparchus and artifactId hipparchus-core,
hipparchus-clustering, hipparchus-fft, hipparchus-fitting,
hipparchus-genetics, hipparchus-geometry, hipparchus-ode,
and hipparchus-optim. There is also an hipparchus-migration
artifact to help migrating from Apache Commons Math.
Maven internal mechanism will download automatically all artifacts
and dependencies as required.
