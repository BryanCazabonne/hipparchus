## Development Library version

The development version of the Hipparchus library is always available to
download from our version control system. We use [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
as our SCM. The anonymous read access to our Git repository  allows users who
need the latest features and the latest bug fixes to get them even before an
official release.

The Git repository can be cloned using the following command, which can
be easily adapted if you are using one of the numerous Git graphical
user interface available or if Git is supported by you integrated
development environment:

    git clone https://github.com/Hipparchus-Math/hipparchus.git
