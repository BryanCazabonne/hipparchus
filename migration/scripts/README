This folder contains tools to help migrating an application
from Apache Commons Math to Hipparchus.

There are scripts that can be run directly from the command
line, and substitution patterns used by the scripts.

Unix/Linux:
===========

The migrate.sh file is a shell script intended to be used for
Unix/Linux operating systems. It is typically run as follows:

 sh migrate.sh --dir src --dir doc \
               --ignore .git \
               --ext .java --ext .txt --ext .md

Any OS:
=======

The migrate.py file is a python script intended to be used in
any environment with a python interpreter. It is typically run
as follows:

 python migrate.py --dir src --dir doc \
                   --ignore .git \
                   --ext .java --ext .txt --ext .md

Documentation:
==============

The --dir option specifies the top-level directory containing
the application files to migrate. The directory will be
crawled recursively. The option can be repeated several times.

The --ignore option specifies directories that will be ignored
while looking for files to edit.

The --ext option specifies the extensions of the files to edit.
The option can be repeated several times.

There is a --nosave option that can be used if the original files
must be completely wiped after having been edited. If the option
is not used, the original files will be renamed with .orig appended
to their names, along side with the edited files. Note that if the
script is interrupted for some reason, there may be some spurious
.orig files remaining even if the -nosave option has been used.

There is a --dry-run option that can be used to check which files
would be modified, without really modifying them.

There is a --packages-subst that can be used to select a different
set of rules for packages substitution. The patterns in this file
must follow the same model as the distributed packages.subst file.
If the option is not used, the distributed packages.subst file
will be used by default. It is possible to set the file to the
empty string (using --packages-subst "") to ignore packages
substitutions.

There is a --classes-subst that can be used to select a different
set of rules for classes substitution. The patterns in this file
must follow the same model as the distributed classes.subst file.
If the option is not used, the distributed classes.subst file
will be used by default.
