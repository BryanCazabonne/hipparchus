This file is used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a JIRA search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
SVN commits.

To generate the file RELEASE-NOTES.txt from this file:

mvn changes:announcement-generate -Prelease-notes [-Dchanges.version]

The <action> type attribute can be add,update,fix,remove.

<!-- NOTE:
The description attribute entries below are specially formatted 
so as to improve the layout of the generated text release notes.

The parsing process removes all line feeds, replacing them with a single space.
The Velocity template in src/changes/release-notes.vm has been enhanced to replace pairs of adjacent spaces
with a new-line in the release notes. (These spaces are ignored when displaying HTML).
If the output is not quite correct, check for invisible trailing spaces!

    <release version="1.0" date="TBD" description="This is the first release of the library">
      <action dev="psteitz" type="update">
        Renamed TestUtils in core stat.inference to InferenceTestUtils and TestUtils in
        the core unit test package to UnitTestUtils.
      </action>
      <action dev="psteitz" type="update">
        Moved EmpiricalDistribution and MultivariateNormalExpectationMaximization from
        the random package into stat.fitting and dropped ValueServer.
      </action>
      <action dev="psteitz" type="update">
        Moved sampling (random deviate generation) from distribution implementations 
        to RandomDataGenerator in the random package.
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="remove">
        Removed interface "DoubleArray".
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="remove">
        Removed interface "NumberTransformer" and classes "TransformerMap" and
        "DefaultTransformer" related to transformation of arbitrary objects
        to double primitives.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" due-to="Andrea Antolino">
        Fix DerivativeStructure.pow for 0 argument and power less than 1.
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="fix">
        Fix "FastMath#round(..)" to comply to changed contract of "Math#round()" in Java 8.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix">
        Fixed DerivativeStructure.pow(0.0) which was NaN when the DS was 0, despite it should
        always be 1.0 in this case, regardless of the base (even if the base is NaN, in fact).
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="add">
        Added Gauss-Laguerre quadrature for integration of improper integrals.
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="add">
        Added "AggregatableStatistic" interface for statistics that can
        aggregate results.
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="update">
        Added aggregation capabilities to "StreamingStatistics", replacing
        the removed class "AggregatingSummaryStatistics".
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="remove">
        Removed "SynchronizedSummaryStatistics", "SynchronizedDescriptiveStatistics"
        and "SynchronizedMultivariateSummaryStatistics". All implementations
        are considered to be not threadsafe. Aggregation of results is preferred
        over synchronization.
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="update">
        Renamed "SummaryStatistics" to "StreamingStatistics".
        Additionally, removed support for setting custom statistics
        implementations.
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="update">
        Replaced "VectorialMean" with a more generic class "VectorialStorelessStatistic"
        which supports to apply any "StorelessUnivariateStatistic" on vector data.
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="remove">
        Removed static "copy(A, B)" methods for storeless statistics.
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="update">
        "Median" does not extend from "Percentile" anymore, but uses composition instead.
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="update">
        Summary statistics based on external moments (e.g. Mean, Variance)
        are now immutable.
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="update">
        Simplified "BinomialConfidenceInterval" and its implementations
        into class "BinomialProportion".
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="remove">
        Removed accuracy parameter in constructors of "RealDistribution" implementations
        that calculate the inverse cumulative probability analytically.
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="update">
        Refactored distribution implementations into separate sub-packages:
        "discrete", "continuous" and "multivariate".
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="remove">
        Removed "copyOf" and "copyOfRange" methods in "MathArrays". "Object#clone()"
        and "Arrays#copyOfRange(...)" should be used instead.
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="update">
        Simplified "PivotingStrategyInterface" and implementations into single
        enum class "PivotingStrategy".
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="update">
        "RealVector#Entry" is now public.
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="update">
        "RealLinearOperator" is now an interface.
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="update">
        "Frequency" class now uses generics. For similar functionality as previous
        class wrt integer numbers, use "LongFrequency" which supports adding
        different integer number types (e.g. int, long, short) to the same
        "LongFrequency" instance. 
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Simplified exception hierarchy.
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="update">
        Modularized the library.
