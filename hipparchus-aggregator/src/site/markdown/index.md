# Hipparchus: a mathematics Library

 Hipparchus is a library of lightweight, self-contained
 mathematics and statistics components addressing the most common
 problems not available in the Java programming language.

## Guiding principles:

  * Real-world application use cases determine development priority.
  * This package emphasizes small, easily integrated components
     rather than large libraries with complex dependencies and
     configurations.
  * All algorithms are fully documented and follow generally
     accepted best practices.
  * In situations where multiple standard algorithms exist, a
     Strategy pattern is used to support multiple implementations.
  * Limited dependencies. No external dependencies beyond the
     core Java platform (at least Java 1.8 starting with version
     1.0 of the library).
